Evaluate what action to take after context compression in an AI coding session. Return only JSON.

## Original Task(s)
{{task_summary}}

## Agent's Last Response (before compression)
{{last_assistant_response}}

## Tools Used
{{tools_used}}

## Detected Indicators
- Git commands used: {{has_git_commands}}
- PR/Issue references found: {{has_pr_issue_ref}}

Determine the best action after compression. Check in this order:

## Decision Priority:

### 1. NEEDS_CLARIFICATION (check first)
Return this if ANY of these are true:
- task_summary contains "(no task found)", "(empty)", or is extremely vague
- task_summary has generic text like "Help with the thing" without specifics
- last_assistant_response is "(no response found)" or empty
- You cannot determine what the agent was actually doing
- Context is too degraded to make an informed decision
- Agent is blocked on missing credentials/secrets or external access the user must provide
  (e.g., API keys, AWS creds, OAuth consent, 2FA, account access)

### 2. TASK_COMPLETE
Return this if:
- Agent's response shows completion: "done", "finished", "completed", "merged ✓"
- Task was simple and fully accomplished
- No "next steps" or "now I will..." pending work mentioned
- Git cleanup/maintenance tasks that are finished (even if has_git_commands=true)

### 3. NEEDS_GITHUB_UPDATE  
Return this ONLY if ALL are true:
- has_pr_issue_ref = true (there's an actual PR/issue being worked on)
- Agent is actively working on that PR/issue (not just mentioned it)
- Task is NOT complete yet

### 4. CONTINUE_TASK (default)
Return this if:
- Clear task in progress with specific next steps
- No GitHub update needed
- Context is sufficient to continue

Return JSON only:
{
  "action": "needs_github_update" | "continue_task" | "needs_clarification" | "task_complete",
  "hasActiveGitWork": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "nudgeMessage": "Context-aware message to send to the agent"
}

Guidelines for nudgeMessage:
- If needs_github_update: Tell agent to use `gh pr comment` or `gh issue comment` to summarize progress
- If continue_task: Brief reminder of what they were working on
- If needs_clarification: Ask agent to summarize current state and what's needed
- If task_complete: Empty string or brief acknowledgment
