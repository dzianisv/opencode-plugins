Evaluate what action to take after context compression in an AI coding session. Return only JSON.

## Original Task(s)
{{task_summary}}

## Agent's Last Response (before compression)
{{last_assistant_response}}

## Tools Used
{{tools_used}}

## Detected Indicators
- Git commands used: {{has_git_commands}}
- PR/Issue references found: {{has_pr_issue_ref}}

════════════════════════════════════════

Determine the best action after compression:

1. **needs_github_update**: Agent was working on a PR/issue and should update it with progress before continuing
2. **continue_task**: Agent should simply continue where it left off
3. **needs_clarification**: Significant context was lost, user input may be needed
4. **task_complete**: Task appears to be finished, no action needed

Return JSON only:
{
  "action": "needs_github_update" | "continue_task" | "needs_clarification" | "task_complete",
  "hasActiveGitWork": true/false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "nudgeMessage": "Context-aware message to send to the agent"
}

Guidelines for nudgeMessage:
- If needs_github_update: Tell agent to use `gh pr comment` or `gh issue comment` to summarize progress
- If continue_task: Brief reminder of what they were working on
- If needs_clarification: Ask agent to summarize current state and what's needed
- If task_complete: Empty string or brief acknowledgment
