════════════════════════════════════════

Determine if the agent is stuck and needs a nudge to continue. Consider:
1. If agent asked a clarifying question → NOT stuck (waiting for user)
2. If agent is mid-tool-call (tool status: running) → NOT stuck (working)
3. If agent stopped mid-sentence or mid-thought → STUCK
4. If agent completed response but no further action → check if task requires more
5. If output tokens = 0 and long delay → likely STUCK
6. If agent listed "Next Steps" but didn't continue → STUCK (premature stop)

Return JSON only:
{
  "stuck": true/false,
  "reason": "genuinely_stuck" | "waiting_for_user" | "working" | "complete",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "shouldNudge": true/false,
  "nudgeMessage": "optional: brief message to send if nudging"
}
